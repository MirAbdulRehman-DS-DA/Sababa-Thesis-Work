🔍 Project Summary & Notes (Drug Interaction Modeling)

✅ Core Files and Structure

main_database_cleaned_and_encoded.csv: Final processed dataset of all drug features (stored in Drugbank_final_database/).

drug_interactions_encoded.csv: Final encoded drug-to-drug interaction file (also in Drugbank_final_database/).

🖠 Feature Engineering Summary

🤩 1. Initial Feature Extraction (from XML)

Parsed a complex DrugBank XML file.

Extracted detailed features: classification, pharmacodynamics, routes, clearance, sequences, experimental properties, drug interactions, categories, pathways, etc.

Created multiple CSVs: main_database.csv, drug_interactions.csv, drug_categories.csv, etc.

🧪 2. Custom Feature Engineering Functions

extract_boiling_point()

Extracts numeric boiling point values from mixed-format strings (e.g., “586.9±60.0 °C at 760 mmHg”).

Returns the average if a range is detected.

extract_melting_point()

Parses entries like "244-247 °C (as chloride salt)" and extracts average temperature values.

extract_isoelectric_point()

Filters out non-numeric values and returns float or NaN.

Handles range cases like "5.4–6.2".

extract_float()

Generic utility to extract numeric value from any unit or formatted text (e.g., "4.64e-02 g/l", ">10 mg/ml").

Used for Water Solubility.

extract_pka()

Extracts pKa values including strongest acidic/basic when available.

Handles sentences like "15.06 (Strongest acidic)" and "9.29 (acid), 4.77 (base)".

🧬 3. SMILES Processing

encode_smiles(smile)

Converts SMILES string to a fixed 8-digit hash value.

Useful for traditional ML models as a categorical identifier.

extract_smiles_features(smile)

Extracts basic molecular descriptors:

Atom count, bond count, ring count.

Number of stereocenters.

Good for adding chemically meaningful structure for ML or DL models.

⚡ Encoding Design Decision:

✅ Kept original SMILES column.

✅ Added both encoded and feature-extracted versions.

⚠️ Note: Enables flexibility between ML and DL pipelines.

🔁 4. Pathway Data Integration

Merged pathways.csv with main_database.csv.

Features created:

pathway_count: Total pathways per drug.

unique_enzyme_count: Distinct enzymes across all pathways.

unique_pathway_categories: Distinct category types.

has_pathway_info: Boolean flag.

✅ Final CSV: main_database_with_properties_and_pathways.csv.

🤖 5. Modeling Preparation Strategy

🧫 Goal:

Build an ensemble model combining:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

SVM

Random Forest

📂 Input Files for ML:

main_database_cleaned_and_encoded.csv: All drug features.

drug_interactions_encoded.csv: Descriptions converted to labels (planned).

🧠 6. Drug Interaction Label Discussion

Observation:

Interaction descriptions showed repeating patterns with only drug names changing.

Idea: Normalize these descriptions by removing drug names.

Labeling approach considered:

One-hot encoding or frequency-based class mapping of normalized description.

Merge normalized interaction label with features of Drug A and Drug B from main_database.csv.

🔍 7. General Debates & Considerations

📉 No drug had 100% complete data → led to strategies for feature selection and imputation.

🧪 Discussed identifying the most populated/important features.

🗃️ Ensured relational integrity between multiple CSVs using primary_drugbank_id.

✅ Decided on merging SMILES/experimental/pathway info only where it adds usable info to avoid redundancy.
